6 R 

SOW -- ms docs
project Plan proposal --> presales 
-- 
1. Assesment phase 55k
- what we have now ?
2. Mobile phase (depends generally min 6 month) => upto 400k max cap  ==> cosulting partners suffer if you strech too long
bigger ARR ==> big time taken
deep discovery --> retain or Retire 
landing zone ==> no UAT / Prd / SIT ==> Only 1 ==> genrally takes 90 days
* not more than 200 vm => don't create a landing zone
checklist of requirements while creating a landing zone
war
security risk and compliance review 
automation needs requiremnet check
sample poc -- stateless and stateful app ==> customer tells these are non critical apps ==> move them
- Rehost Here 

Next Step: Migration Plan ==> 25% of ARR from AWS + Customer Pays if this amt is less
- refactor + modernise == here more money + time you get 
- replatform 
- repurchase
